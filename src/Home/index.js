                            I am a Computer Engineer graduated from Pulchowk Campus. I have 3+ years of experience
                            in Software Development. I have worked on techstacks such as HTML/CSS/Javascript,
                            ReactJs, NodeJs, .net, Groovy and Grails and Android Programming with Java. I have practice
                            mainly of SQL databases like MySQL and SQLite.<br/><br/>
                            Other than professional career, I like reading books. Once in a fortnite, I try to write
                            but fail successfully. Lol. I also have a hobby of reading old Nepali literatures.
